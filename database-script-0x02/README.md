- Payment records linked to bookings
- User reviews
- Private messaging between users

## ðŸ§° Tables Covered

- `users`
- `properties`
- `bookings`
- `payments`
- `reviews`
- `messages`

## ðŸ§ª How to Test Locally

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL and pgAdmin installed.
2. Create a database (e.g., `airbnb_clone`) in pgAdmin.
3. Run `schema.sql` to set up the database structure.
4. Run `seed.sql` to populate the tables with sample data.
5. Browse the data visually via pgAdmin or use queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM bookings;
```
